### todo

https://github.com/0bs-chat/zerobs/tree/feat/message-queue : the message queue function.

---
- google integration (the code is already there just need to setup oauth)
- business related mcp with ability to autofill connection info (like auto fetching api key/oauth key for the headers in mcp using oauth, etc to reduce friction)

- need message queue system
- immediate send, wait for file to be processed check on the frontend instead of backend
